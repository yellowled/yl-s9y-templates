The default templates provided by [Serendipity](https://s9y.org) hold a lot of stuff I usually drop when starting a new project. This is an already stripped-down version of said templates.

Note that this does not contain CSS or JS files. I usually replace those with files provided by [my project HTML boilerplate](https://github.com/yellowled/yl-bp).
